										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just read Martha Kenney’s “<a href="http://doi.org/10.1177/0306312715607413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counting, accounting, and accountability: Helen Verran’s relational empiricism</a>”.<br>
The article is currently available through the <a href="http://sss.sagepub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Studies of Science</a> <a href="http://sss.sagepub.com/content/early/recent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnlineFirst</a> service. Intentionally or not, it sits nicely with other articles brought together to examine <a id="tippy_tip0_1252_anchor"></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><a style="font-size: 145%;" href="http://doi.org/10.1177/0306312715607413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenney, M. (2015). Counting, accounting, and accountability: Helen Verran’s relational empiricism. Social Studies of Science, 1–23.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Kenney’s article is very much a homage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Verran" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helen Verran</a> and her wonderful book <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3631540.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Science and an African Logic</a>. She pays special attention to Verran’s efforts at <em>decomposition</em> and frames these through a lens of accountability. Care is given by Kenny to differentiate this kind of accounting from that of “contemporary neo-liberal bureaucracies” that run the risk of strengthening “the academic culture that privileges critique and revelation over other, more subtle and creative, approaches.” <span id="more-787"></span>(p. 8)<br>
What I particularly like about Kenney’s reading of <em>Science and an African Logic</em> is the emphasis she places on Verran’s ‘generative critique’ and, in these same terms, the way we might come to understand the empirical/ethnographic account.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Verran […] helps us see ethnographic writing conventions as generative, not of true representations (tracings of real relations) but of promising fictions, echoing Strathern’s definition of ethnography as an ‘effort to create a world parallel to the perceived world’” (p. 10).</p></blockquote>
<p>For me, this is such a helpful way to think about the accounts we produce as field researchers. It gets us past questions about factual or realist representation. It reminds me of something I heard the singer PJ Harvey say on Radio 4 a while back. Talking about Harold Pinter’s poetry and ‘the poetry’ of Kubrick’s films, she evocatively describes what she sees in them:</p>
<blockquote style="font-size: 205%; font-style: italic"><a id="tippy_tip1_8072_anchor"></a></blockquote>
<p>As with Pinter and Kubrick, then, I appreciate Kenney reminding us that ethnographic accounts such as Verran’s must be written/read as “an alternative way of figuring and paying attention to differences that may enable different forms of response and participation.” (p. 11)</p>

<blockquote><p>Puig de la Bellacasa, M. (2012). “Nothing comes without its world”: thinking with care. <em>The Sociological Review</em>, 60(2), 197–216.</p></blockquote>
<p>Puig de la Bellacasa writes evocatively on Donna Haraway’s work&nbsp;and draws it&nbsp;into an idea of care. I especially like how she figures care as a way of bringing things into productive relations with one another, not narrowing in on oppositional differences, but seeking a generative relationality.</p>
<blockquote><a id="tippy_tip2_6160_anchor"></a></blockquote>
<p>One thing that’s noteworthy is the absence of Annemarie Mol in this text, with her <a id="tippy_tip3_2094_anchor"></a> in science and technology scholarship. I wonder if this has to do with her only just&nbsp;veiled criticisms of some in feminist technoscience through&nbsp;her remarks on ‘new materialism’:</p>
<blockquote><a id="tippy_tip4_3034_anchor"></a></blockquote>
<p>Whatever the case, Puig de la Bellacasa “speculative reading” of Haraway and her thickening of <em>care</em> provides a helpful basis for thinking <a id="tippy_tip5_2018_anchor"></a> about what we know and how we know it.</p>
<div class="tippy" data-title="Caring and relating thus share conceptual and ontological resonance. In worlds made of heterogeneous interdependent forms and processes of life and matter, to care about something, or for somebody, is inevitably to create relation. In this way care holds the peculiar significance of being a ‘non normative obligation’ (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010): it is concomitant to life – not something forced upon living beings by a moral order; yet it obliges in that for life to be liveable it needs being fostered." data-showheader="false" data-anchor="#tippy_tip2_6160_anchor">p. 198, Puig la Bellacasa (2012)</div>
<div class="tippy" data-title="central contribution on the topic of care" data-showheader="false" data-anchor="#tippy_tip3_2094_anchor">See Mol, A. 2008. <em>The Logic of Care: Health and the Problem of Patient Choice</em>. New York: Routledge.</div>
<div class="tippy" data-title="As the new materialism forgets these relational engagements and affordances it has no ￼way of talking about what matter ‘itself’ does, other than naively echoing natural science textbooks and journal articles – minus the materials and methods sections. Decades of work in STS is being disdainfully discarded. In the process most of the questions that ‘relational materialism’ was trying to raise are being sidelined, too." data-showheader="false" data-anchor="#tippy_tip4_3034_anchor">… pp. 380–381, Mol, A. Mind your plate! The ontonorms of Dutch dieting. <em>Social Studies of Science</em> 43, 3 (2013), 379–396.</div>
<div class="tippy" data-title="diffractively" data-showheader="false" data-anchor="#tippy_tip5_2018_anchor">That is, productively or generatively.</div>
