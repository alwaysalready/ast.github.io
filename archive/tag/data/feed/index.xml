<strong><a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/apl/events/seminars/#d.en.740154" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ABSTRACT</a></strong>
<p>In this talk, I want to revisit a piece I wrote in <a href="/archive/publications/alex-taylor-2016/">2016</a>. The piece, a chapter in Dawn Nafus‚Äô book Quantified (2016), was intended as a story of promise, a fabulation about London‚Äôs bike rental scheme and how it might be used to re-imagine new figurings of human-machine relations. Thinking across, askew, or ‚Äúathwart‚Äù (Hustak &amp; Myers 2013), my experimenting with the relational capacities of bicycles, a city, (bio)sensing and the proliferation of data-everywhere, aimed to resist the ‚Äúagencies of homogenization‚Äù (Scott 1998) to explore the conditions of possibility for other worldings (Haraway 2016).</p>
<p>Reflecting on this work, I‚Äôve felt a dissatisfaction with my efforts to throw together mixtures of data at all scales, with the attempts at thickening and enlivening the relations. It all felt too flat, too lacking in vitality. So, at the risk of appearing self indulgent, this talk will present some early ideas for a different story woven in and through the thicket of relations. Struggling to weave myself into London‚Äôs legacy with slavery and the violent erasures of bodies and agency (Hartman 2008), I‚Äôll be trying to place myself at a much more fragile and tenuous juncture of space-time, but at the same time still seeking to work fruitfully in/with the conditions of (im-)possibility.</p>

I presented at the <a href="http://datapublics.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Publics conference</a> last weekend, at Lancaster University. Got lots of helpful feedback to some early thoughts on publics (thinking with some of my old favourites, Despret, Haraway, Marres, Stengers, etc.).<br>
Provoked by Vinciane Despret‚Äôs ‚ÄúW for Work‚Äù, in ‚ÄúWhat would animals say if we asked the right questions?‚Äù,<a id="tippy_tip2_6434_anchor"></a> my starting point was the question:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="font-size:300%">Are we thinking well<br>with data publics?</div>
<p><span id="more-3272"></span>As Despret asks of animals and their work, my provocation was to ask not just whether ‚Äúdata publics‚Äù offer us something (whether they are useful), but whether we work well with them, whether they ‚Äòmake <em>more</em> interesting‚Äô and give us the ‚Äòchance‚Äô to think differently.<a id="tippy_tip3_8086_anchor"></a></p>

<strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We present findings from a five-week deployment of voting technologies in a city neighbourhood. Drawing on Marres‚Äô (2012) work on material participation and Massey‚Äôs (2005) conceptualisation of space as dynamic, we designed the deployment such that the technologies (which were situated in residents‚Äô homes, on the street, and available online) would work in concert, cutting across the neighbourhood to make visible, juxtapose and draw together the different ‚Äòsmall worlds‚Äô within it. We demonstrate how the material infrastructure of the voting devices set in motion particular processes and interpretations of participation, putting data in place in a way that had ramifications for the recognition of heterogeneity. We conclude that redistributing participation means not only opening up access, so that everyone can participate, or even providing a multitude of voting channels, so that people can participate in different ways. Rather, it means making visible multiplicity, challenging notions of similarity, and showing how difference may be productive.</p></blockquote>

This chapter tells a story of promise, one about London‚Äôs bike rental data and how it might be used to re-imagine new figurings of human-machine relations. Experimenting with the relational capacities of (bio)sensing and the proliferation of data-everywhere, the possibilities of other worlds are imagined. Mixtures of data at all scales are thrown together, playing with and testing out a thickening and enlivening of relations, new edges, and making room for difference‚Äîfor different assemblies of bodies, space and time. Relations are brought into being that might just resist the ‚Äúagencies of homogenization‚Äù (<a id="tippy_tip4_2652_anchor"></a>) and that mess about in the unevenness and plurality that makes London vibrant.</p></blockquote>

The book has been incredibly useful for a few of us in thinking through the Tenison Road materials, especially the latter stages of the work where we deployed a range of devices for voting and visualising data. The book has helped us to see the Bullfrogs, physical charts and posters we‚Äôve built as ‚Äúparticipation technologies‚Äù (to use Noortje‚Äôs term) and reflect on how they have opened up a wider range of ways for people to engage in local and civic matters. Combined with Doreen Massey‚Äôs ideas on <a id="tippy_tip6_9449_anchor"></a>, we‚Äôre beginning to see the entanglements of participation and technology as a means of enacting place, and expanding the ways place is, as it were, performed. Place then comes to be something that can be actively figured through a diverse set of participation technologies.</p>

Here‚Äôs the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>We present findings from a year-long engagement with a street and its community. The work explores how the production and use of data is bound up with place, both in terms of physical and social geography. We detail three strands of the project. First, we consider how residents have sought to curate existing data about the street in the form of an archive with physical and digital components. Second, we report endeavours to capture data about the street‚Äôs environment, especially of vehicle traffic. Third, we draw on the possibilities afforded by technologies for polling opinion. We reflect on how these engagements have: materialised distinctive relations between the community and their data; surfaced flows and contours of data, and spatial, temporal and social boundaries; and enacted a multiplicity of ‚Äòsmall worlds‚Äô. We consider how such a conceptualisation of <em>data-in-place</em> is relevant to the design of technology.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">Irina Shklovski, Scott D. Mainwaring, Halla Hrund Sk√∫lad√≥ttir, and H√∂skuldur Borgthorsson. 2014. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556288.2557421&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=366422751&amp;CFTOKEN=10483891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leakiness and creepiness in app space: perceptions of privacy and mobile app use</a>.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2347‚Äì2356.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The paper got me thinking about some broader (and long-standing) issues I‚Äôve been working through myself related to the researcher‚Äôs agential (and <span style="color: #000000;">often inadvertent)</span>&nbsp;role in empirical research. What follows&nbsp;are some slightly amended comments I‚Äôve shared with Irina.<span id="more-431"></span><br>
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556288.2557421&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=366422751&amp;CFTOKEN=10483891"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-435 size-large" src="/archive/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Leakiness-1024x824-1403785070.png" alt="Leakiness and creepiness in app space" width="1024" height="964"></a><br>
Something that&nbsp;strikes me is that the paper presents&nbsp;a set of examples (dare I say data) about how people make sense of worlds from, if you will, outside of them. I wonder to what extent this is different to how we actually use our mobile devices (how we <em>enact</em> these worlds)? So to what extent are the reflections on talk about privacy, creepiness, leekages, helplessness, etc. insights into how we&nbsp;rationalise what we&nbsp;do as opposed to insights into <em>what</em> we do? I‚Äôm not saying this (I hope) to make that well-worn argument about people&nbsp;not doing what they&nbsp;say we do. Nor do I say it to lessen the value of the interviews and survey results&nbsp;presented. I think it‚Äôs important though to draw attention to the kind of materials being examined&nbsp;and&nbsp;what can be sensibly said about them.<br>
Here‚Äôs one take on the paper, just to try to illustrate this point a bit. The theorising from Altman and Nissenbaum suggest the&nbsp;presumption of some discrete (and somewhat stable) ideas of interior, exterior, private, public, space, etc. etc. Yes, there may be a fluidity to how things move between these categories (and they may change over time), but nevertheless, the implication is there are for all intents and purposes a set of stable, applicable categories. My suggestion isn‚Äôt that this is a strong claim, but it does feel like it‚Äôs more or less the working assumption in the paper.<br>
In&nbsp;being careful about the kinds of empirical materials being used, I think there‚Äôs a different way to think about this. I wonder whether performativity might be a useful concept to work with? Might we say that these things&nbsp;the researchers&nbsp;and the informants collectively spoke about, e.g. selves, data, devices, third parties, privacy etc. are being drawn together to enact just these categories? What we might be seeing here is not an indication of how data falls into (or threads across) these categories, but how we enact them when we talk about our mobile devices and how we make sense of data in those self same terms. (This is one of the ideas&nbsp;I take from Nelson Goodman‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ways_of_Worldmaking.html?id=Y5aMV3EE6WcC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ways of Worldmaking</em></a>‚Äù (1978).<a id="tippy_tip7_2236_anchor"></a>&nbsp;I love his remark: ‚ÄúThe uniformity of nature we marvel at or the unreliability we protest belongs to a world of our own making.‚Äù p.10).<br>
Take this statement, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThis is completely ridiculous, I would not invite people into my closet, this is way out of line. No I don‚Äôt find it appropriate to give up personal information in exchange for this game and that they don‚Äôt need more approval than they apparently do.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>What are the circumstances (discursive and material) that would allow a conversation to unfold in this way and for things like smart phones to be talked about like closets? Moreover, how is it that data on these devices should be understood as personal and in some fashion belonging to the person speaking? I don‚Äôt see any of these things to be given. Rather, I want to ask in what way the assemblage of interview, people, devices, data, etc. allow for this kind of talk and enactment of categories like personal, information, right vs. wrong, etc. (I take this argument directly from Helen Verran‚Äôs wonderful book, ‚Äú<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pruf2NEVuGMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Science and an African Logic</a>‚Äù.<span style="color: #000000;"><a id="tippy_tip8_6963_anchor"></a></span><br>
This might seem like an unnecessary theorising, but I think it comes back to the question of the kind of empirical materials presented in the paper and what can be said&nbsp;about them. From the&nbsp;results, I don‚Äôt know whether one&nbsp;can really say people have stable ideas of values tied to what‚Äôs personal and what‚Äôs creepy when it comes to infringements on the personal. I <em>do</em> think what can be usefully asked is ‚ÄòHow is it that this assemblage of actors/agents allows us to talk about things like private, public, creepiness, leekages, helplessness, etc.?‚Äô<br>
Where this becomes concrete, I think, is when we then ask how might things be different? So in what other ways might we talk about these things and what are the possibilities of using matter (or design)&nbsp;to intervene? For instance, how might the data being collected be refigured (discursively and materially) as not personal? What would it take in the design of these systems (and their interfaces) for people to talk about the data being collected as not about them in any intimate way, but about some ‚Äòimpersonal‚Äô aggregation of data from a network of nodes? For me this offers&nbsp;the beginnings for thinking differently about data and what it might enable.</p>
