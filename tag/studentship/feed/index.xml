<p>There’s a list of research topics <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-human-computer-interaction-design/phd-topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

<p>Personally, I’m very open to suggestions on topic. It would be thrilling to see proposals for critical and perhaps materialist orientations to technoscience. Oh, and feminist, intersectional thinking would be high on my wish list.</p>
