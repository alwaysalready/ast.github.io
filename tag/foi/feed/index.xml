<div class="col-9 col-md-5">In response to a story reported via a number of news sites and exploring a thread in my own research, I submitted a Freedom of Information (FoI) <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/amount_paid_per_year_to_repay_sl#outgoing-754175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request</a> to Her Majesty’s Treasury on the 7th April. In brief, I requested further details on the amount paid per year to repay the Slavery Abolition Act loan, a loan taken by the UK government in 1834 to ‘compensate’ slave owners for their loss of ‘property’. Shockingly, this loan was being repaid up until 2015 by UK taxpayers.<br>
<br><br>
I made <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/amount_paid_per_year_to_repay_sl#outgoing-754175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my request</a> using the amazing <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatDoTheyKnow</a> site. I’ve included the text from my request below for context.</div>
<div class="col-9 col-md-6"><a href="http://ast.io/download/4124/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/ast.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HMTreasry_FOI-request.png?resize=640%2C438&#038;ssl=1" alt="Screen shot of written response by HM Treasury to FOI request" width="640" height="438" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4126" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>

<blockquote style="width: 380px; margin: 3rem 0 3rem 6%; font-size: .7rem; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 10px 10px; border: 1px solid black;"><p>To Her Majesty’s Treasury,<br>
As widely reported, in 1833–35 [1] the UK government borrowed £20m, 40% of its national budget, to “recompense” slave owners for losing their “property” [2] — under the Slavery Abolition Act. On 9 February 2018, HM Treasury announced (via Twitter) that this loan had been paid in full. A related FOI request that HM Treasury responded to on 9 February 2018 sets the date of the loans ‘consolidation’ to be the 1 February 2015: “The 4% Consolidated Loan was redeemed on 1 February 2015” [3].<br>
Under the Freedom of Information act, I request further details of this loan. Specifically, I request the annual amount paid per year since 1833–35.<br>
I also request to total sum paid to repay the loan, including interest.<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
Alex Taylor<br>

1. From the documentation available, it’s unclear whether the loan began in 1833 or 1835.<br>
2. This was covered by a number of news organisations. Two examples from the Guardian follow:<br>
— <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/12/treasury-tweet-slavery-compensate-slave-owners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfre…</a><br>
— <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfre…</a><br>
3. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slavery-abolition-act-1833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.gov.uk/government/publicatio…</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Having left their written response to the last day of the 20 working days usually allotted, HM Treasury replied with a somewhat muddled message offering some details, but not fully answering my request. Some equivalent to “HM Treasury does not hold information/records” was used four times in a one-page response:</p>
<blockquote style="width: 380px; margin: 3rem 0 3rem 6%; font-size: .7rem; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 10px 10px; border: 1px solid black;"><p>“HM Treasury does not hold information within the scope of your request.”<br>
“HM Treasury does not hold records dating from this period.”<br>
“HM Treasury does not hold any detailed information on the structure or amounts of repayments…”<br>
“HM Treasury does not hold information on the total interest paid…”</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter from HM Treasury is available via WhatDoTheyKnow <a href="http://ast.io/download/4124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br>
I will be continuing this research and share any further information I’m able to obtain.</p>
