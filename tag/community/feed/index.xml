<p>In “Experiments in collective counting”, Clara and I write about the (ac)counting practices on an estate in South East London and our efforts to intervene in a resolutely singular logic of community and value.</p>
<div class="tippy" data-title="<em>The Peckham Experiment</em>" data-showtitle="false" data-anchor="#tippy_tip0_4151_anchor"><strong>The Peckham Experiment</strong> was a social experiment targeting health. The Pioneer Health Foundation, the legacy to the experiment, describes it as “an investigation into the nature of health.” From 1926 to 1950 it was based in Peckham, south London at the Pioneer Health Centre.

<strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We present findings from a five-week deployment of voting technologies in a city neighbourhood. Drawing on Marres’ (2012) work on material participation and Massey’s (2005) conceptualisation of space as dynamic, we designed the deployment such that the technologies (which were situated in residents’ homes, on the street, and available online) would work in concert, cutting across the neighbourhood to make visible, juxtapose and draw together the different ‘small worlds’ within it. We demonstrate how the material infrastructure of the voting devices set in motion particular processes and interpretations of participation, putting data in place in a way that had ramifications for the recognition of heterogeneity. We conclude that redistributing participation means not only opening up access, so that everyone can participate, or even providing a multitude of voting channels, so that people can participate in different ways. Rather, it means making visible multiplicity, challenging notions of similarity, and showing how difference may be productive.</p></blockquote>
