					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ast.io/controlling-access-buddypress-pages/#comment-44&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Alex,
Thank you for the reply. I&#039;m so sorry for not being clear in the message. I didn&#039;t enable Group in my Buddypress. The membership I was referring to was from a membership plugin that would allow me to restrict some content (posts and pages) to a certain members only based on their membership level. But it can&#039;t restrict Buddypress at all. And after a member&#039;s membership is cancelled, he can&#039;t access restricted content but can still log in freely, which means he can still access BP. That&#039;s why I need to find a way to block them from BP after their membership is cancelled and log in based on their cancelled membership level, or whatever else that can do the trick. I hope this clears things up a little. Thanks.:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ast.io/controlling-access-buddypress-pages/#comment-43&quot;&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Ed. Glad you&#039;ve got part way there with these suggestions. Just wondering if you can check whether or not your cancelled member is part of a group or not? By cancelling their membership, I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re unsubscribing from a buddypress group, is that right?
If that&#039;s the case, you could use &lt;a href=&quot;http://hookr.io/plugins/buddypress/2.8.2/functions/bp_group_is_member/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;code&gt;bp_group_is_member( $group )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;? So you could add a new &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement or, in example 4, lines 7-9, you could change it to something like:
&lt;code&gt;if ( is_user_logged_in() &amp;&amp; &lt;strong&gt;!bp_group_is_member( $group_id )&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;&amp; [list other criteria to limit page/category access] ) {
8	 wp_redirect( home_url() . &#039;/membership-signup/&#039; );
9	}&lt;/code&gt;
Also worth taking a look at &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hookr.io/functions/groups_is_user_member/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;groups_is_user_member&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Not totally sure what the difference is, but I&#039;ve used it above (line 10), and it seems to work there.]]></description>

If that’s the case, you could use <a href="http://hookr.io/plugins/buddypress/2.8.2/functions/bp_group_is_member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">“<code>bp_group_is_member( $group )</code></a>”? So you could add a new <code>if</code> statement or, in example 4, lines 7–9, you could change it to something like:<br>
<code>if ( is_user_logged_in() &amp;&amp; <strong>!bp_group_is_member( $group_id )</strong> &amp;&amp; [list other criteria to limit page/category access] ) {<br>
8	 wp_redirect( home_url() . '/membership-signup/' );<br>
9	}</code><br>
Also worth taking a look at “<code><a href="http://hookr.io/functions/groups_is_user_member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">groups_is_user_member</a></code>”. Not totally sure what the difference is, but I’ve used it above (line 10), and it seems to work there.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,
This information on &quot;3. Restrict access by member type&quot; is exactly what I&#039;ve been looking for in the past few days. I tried it out on the site I&#039;m building and it does work. However, one problem. I need to block members on my site who have cancelled their membership. I assume cancelled members will no longer have a member type, so for this codes to work, I think they have to be rephrased from
&quot;If the member type is xxx and the URL being loaded con­tains &#039;full-members&#039;, redirect to sign-up page&quot; to
&quot;Unless the member type is yy and the URL being loaded con­tains &quot;full-members&quot;,  redirect to sign-up page&quot;
I&#039;m wondering if you can help with the rephrasing of the codes?
And what if I have more than just one &quot;yy&quot; member type to add to the codes?
Thank you so much. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ast.io/controlling-access-buddypress-pages/#comment-41&quot;&gt;Marcus Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the comment. I found there were quite a few Buddypress pages that were accessible to non-members. I know there&#039;s probably some redundancy in the code above, but I just wanted to make doubly very sure access only went to the right people.
As for making the activity page public, have you looked at building your own page template which includes the activity loop? I&#039;m not sure, but you may be able to control who can see what that way. There&#039;s a basic guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-customize-the-buddypress-activity-loop/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and some options detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/loops-reference/the-activity-stream-loop/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also do a search on customising the BuddyPress activity loop.
I can&#039;t tell for sure whether you can actually make the stream available to non-members, but possibly worth experimenting?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. I thought that buddypress does this by default. For instance, logged out users get redirected to the home page when they try to go to the activity page.
I would be interested in knowing how to show the activity page for logged out users.
Do you know how? :)
Kind regards,
Marcus]]></description>
